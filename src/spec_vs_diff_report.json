  "summary": "Most requested street-fighting retheme work appears implemented: chapters rewritten with street-fight storylines and generated-asset paths, start/chapter copy updated, gritty theme tokens added, and a new BrawlChallenge integrated into the challenge flow with mission progression gated by objectives. However, the diff summary does not show the required generated image files being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, so asset generation/wiring cannot be fully verified.",

      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Generate and wire up new static image assets for the street fighting game by placing them under `frontend/public/assets/generated` (title bg, chapter bgs, portraits set, city map) and update references so no missing-asset paths remain.",
      "reason": "While multiple components now reference `/assets/generated/...png`, the diff summary does not list any newly added PNG files under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, so it’s not verifiable that the required images were actually added and will load without 404s.",
